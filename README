Lua-Aplicado â€“ A random collection of application level Lua libraries
=====================================================================

This library is still in its embryonic phase.
An appropriate description would be added later.

This library depends on some lua-nucleo code (most notably, `import` function).

NOTE: If you need anything as a Lua module, just ask (GitHub message would do).
