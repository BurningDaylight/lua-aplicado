Lua-Aplicado â€“ A random collection of application level Lua libraries
=====================================================================

This library is still in its embryonic phase.
An appropriate description would be added later.

This library depends on some lua-nucleo code (most notably, `import` function).

http://github.com/lua-nucleo/lua-nucleo

To run tests, create a symlink 'lua-nucleo' to lua-nucleo/lua-nucleo
at the root directory of the project.

NOTE: If you need anything as a Lua module, just ask (GitHub message would do).
